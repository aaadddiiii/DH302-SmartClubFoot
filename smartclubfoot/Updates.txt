To Change
1. Change the login process to implement secure cloud login // done
2. Implement the signup page with authentication // done
3. Implement a Splash Screen // very done
4. Implement cloud backend instead of local saving // done for the uploading part (have made some assumptions on data)
5. Implement Admin mode for the professional to see all profiles under him // (doesn't seem viable for now)
6. Change list view to ReCyclerView // would be pain ita
7. Clean the code and make it readable // In process

Ideas
1. Saving of data should be availabe regardless of internet connectivity
2. Login without cloud connectivity
3. Send data to cloud once a day or whenever there is connectivity
